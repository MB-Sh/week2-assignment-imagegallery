Reflection
I found this weeks task challenging. And struggled to used the skeleton given to us. 
I used the HTML to store my image files rather than using JS. This Youtube video was helpful https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM1_SlB2OpY&t=903s

My weblink in VScode was ok but when I launch the Github link it is broken, not sure why. I would need to clarification please.

I definitely have made some progress. I feel I have a lot of weak points using CSS and JS, I am really hoping I grasp it soonest.
